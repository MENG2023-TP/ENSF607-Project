### Applying Fitness functions
-Fitness functions (FF) would be applied to critical areas of the new microservices architecture to measure if they meet the intended design and operational requirements, such as:
1. Correctness FF: ensures the ticket algorithm matches the most appropriate expert
2. Scalability FF: guarantees that system resources scale in response to continuous usage increase.
3. Failure handling FF: validates that the system can recover from routing failures and reassigned tickets appropriately.
4. Availability FF: confirms that ticket entry is continuously accessible to users.

### Monitoring considerations
-The system must incorporate real-time monitoring to track response time and react to potential issues with the end of ensuring operational reliability and robustness. The major monitoring considerations are:
1. Ticket processing, assignments and routing: monitors the success rate from ticket assignment to completion and continuously verifies the latency of the process flow.
2. Notification monitoring: verifies the reliability of SMS notification to repair experts.
3. Security Monitoring: actively scans for data breaches to protect sensitive information.
   
Additional monitoring considerations would include knowledge DB usage, customer feedback, resource utilization, and the health of the system's microservices.
