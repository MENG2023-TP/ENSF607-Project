### Contracts among service:

**Costumer and Admin services**
-Contract type: strict
-Functionalities like signing up for services, ticket submission, billing, experts management, etc. demand strict contracts to maintain transaction integrity and to ensure sensitive data like customer information is protected. Additionally strict contracts ensures a consistent behaviour between the interactions of the system which in turn can provide a better costumer experience.

**Ticket assignment**
-Contract type: loose
-Because the ticket assignment algorithm changes frequently a loose contract allows the system to adapt quickly to the changes without impacting the rest of the system's functionality. It also supports scalability of the system to match a continuous increase response demands.

**Notifications**
-Contract type: loose
-Functionalities like sending emails and sms to costumers and repair experts are one way processes that containing non-sensitive data, because of this we can safely opt for loose contracts with the advantage of obtaining flexibility in integrating new emerging communication technologies and ensures that the system remains relevant. 

**Knowledge database**
-Contract type: loose
-The knowledge database is a collaborative tool used by various repair experts. A loose contract is ideal because if the company decided to release new versions of the mobile application that allow repair experts to submit new types of content. These updates and new content types can be integrated into the database without requiring significant changes.
