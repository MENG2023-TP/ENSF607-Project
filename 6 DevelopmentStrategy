Deploymet Strategy for Monolithic to Microservice Architecture
  Best Appliances 
  Developement, Quality Assessment, and Production 

Development Enviroment:

Monolithic to Micro Service Decomposition
  Identify the different modules or functionalities within the monolithic application that can be decoupled into microservices.
  Begin with non-critical or less complex parts of the system for the initial microservices development. 
  Example:
  Customer management â€“ create a microservice for customer management with its own database. 

Implement Core Microservices
  Develop core microservices such as customer management, ticket creation, ticket assignment, and notification services. 
  Use an event driven architecture, considering the use of an event bus as the API gateway.

Set Up Development Environment
  Create isolated development environments for each microservice to allow developers to work independently on their services.
	Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistency across development environments.
  Example:
  Use Docker to containerize the customer management microservice. Establish a development enviroment for the microsservice 
  with sample data. Set up local enviroment instances for developers to work on specific microservices. 

Implement API Gateway
  Set up the event bus as an API Gateway to handle communication between microservices.
  Ensure that the API Gateway can handle the routing of events and requests between services.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
  Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of microservices.
  Integrate automated testing to catch issues early in the development process.

Quality Assessment Environment:

Integration Testing
  Perform integration testing to ensure that microservices interact correctly with each other.
  Test the overall system's functionality, including ticket creation, assignment, and resolution processes.
  Example:
  Integrate the customer management microservice with other existing monolithic modules. Conducting these integration
  test will ensure correct interaction between the microservice and the monolith. Enable automated testing for the customer management microservice.

Load Testing
  Simulate production-like loads to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle the expected number of users.

Container Orchestration
  Consider deploying microservices using container orchestration tools to manage scalability and availability.

Monitor and Analyze
  Implement monitoring tools to track system behavior and identify any issues.
  Analyze logs and metrics to fine-tune the performance of microservices.

Production Environment:

Rollout Strategy
  Gradual rollout of microservices starting with less critical functionalities and progressively moving to more critical ones.
  Use feature flags to enable/disable specific microservices or features as needed.
  Example:
  Begin with the deploymeny of the customer management microservice to a limited set of production servers. Use the feature flags
  to control exposure of the microservice to a subset of users initially. 

Monitoring and Alerting
  Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems for immediate detection of issues in the production environment.
  Example:
  Monitoring and alerting systems can be used to monitor user interactions, response times, and error rates. 

Scaling Strategy
  Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to adapt to varying loads in the production environment.
  Example:
  Scale individual microservices independently based on their usage patterns. Microservices can be scaled
  horizontally if needed by adding more servers to the microservice. 

Backup and Recovery
  Implement regular backup and recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and availability in case of failures.

Rollback Plan
  Have a well-defined rollback plan in case any issues arise during the production deployment.
  Monitor for anomalies after each deployment phase and be prepared to revert changes if necessary.

Customer Communication:
  Communicate the introduction of the new customer management system to users, providing support resources for
  users encountering issues.
